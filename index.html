        <h1>A List Of The Top 5 Games Of The Decade:</h1>

        <div class="game">
            <h1>5. Mass Effect</h1>
            <img src="https://media.altchar.com/prod/images/940_530/gm-ebe2e4d2-9ec9-4e11-bb3f-6d4d951e959b-asd.jpeg" alt="">
            <p>Dialogue feels natural and engaging. ... Through loyalty missions that dig deep into these characters' pasts to dialogue options that shape the way these characters see the player within this world, every action feels meaningful and impactful, which is a large part why Mass Effect is so incredibly immersive.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="game">
            <h1>4. Portal 2</h1>
            <img src="https://assets.vg247.com/current/2014/02/portal_2.jpg" alt="">
            <p>Besides the amazing physics engine, suitably sterile aesthetics and great sound effects, Portal captured players with its originality. Most FPSes involve blasting through hordes of assailants with bullets/lasers/any other imaginable ammunition which rips enemies to shreds. In Portal, there aren't really any enemies.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="game">
            <h1>3. Dark Souls 3</h1>
            <img src="https://assets.vg247.com/current/2016/04/dark_souls_3_art_2.jpg" alt="">
            <p>Because the gameplay is fun, the characters and lore are quite riveting, there's a lot of different playstyles to try out, bosses are fun to fight, and this game does an excellent job of feeding our inner masochism and rewarding our struggle when we finally succeed.</p>

        <div class="game">
            <h1>2. Red Dead Redemtion</h1>
            <img src="https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/RDR2_Review_19-2060x1159.jpg" alt="">
        </div>

        <div class="game">
            <h1>1. The Last Of Us</h1>
            <img src="https://assets.vg247.com/current/2016/08/the_last_of_us.jpg" alt="">
            <p>The presentation is amazing. Character motion and actions are extremely fluid and lifelike, and contexual animations are great too. The game sounds great, the voice acting is great, and I feel like the story is going to be done in a decent way.</p>
